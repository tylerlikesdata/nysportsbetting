<h1>New York Faces New Set of Challenges With Growing Sports Betting Industry</h1>

  <p>As more and more states have legalized sports betting, business has been booming in the United States. In March 2023 alone, Americans bet just shy of $10 billion on sports. Several states have seen ballooning numbers of wagers over the last half decade. One state that has experienced a particularly high amount of growth is New York.</p>

  <p>About $20 billion has been bet on sports in New York since 2018. That ranks within the top three states in the nation, but according to an executive at the NYS Gaming Commission, that statistic might undersell the dominance of the New York betting market.</p>

  <p>“Based on the size of the state and how fast the industry is growing here,” said Lee Park, “New York has the most robust market in the country. People want to bet, and our state has a lot of people, it’s as simple as that.”</p>

  <p>That money hasn’t been evenly spread throughout the last five years. The number has risen a lot over the last 18 months after a long process of legalizing sports betting in stages.</p>

  <p>The process of legalizing sports betting in the state has been a long one, according to Park. After a Supreme Court case on the matter in 2018, a nationwide push towards legalization started. It was no different in New York, where discussions in the state legislature began soon after the case was decided. Although several in-person sports betting sites opened within a few years, the amount of money bet within the state did not increase very much.</p>

  <p>Part of the reason for that may be that New Yorkers already had access to in-person sports betting through Native American-owned casinos, such as Turning Stone and Point Place.</p>

  <p>After this period of slow growth, the biggest change occurred in January 2022. That’s when online sportsbooks could begin operation in New York. Park said the legalization of online sports betting is really what sparked the industry's growth within the state. Instead of having to travel to a state approved or Native American-owned sports betting site, residents could log on to an app or go to a website. Accessibility for the average person to place a bet reached an all time high.</p>

  <p>The faster the industry has grown in popularity, the faster the state has benefitted. New York has generated over $50 million in sports betting tax revenue every month since August 2022.</p>

  <p>Park said that part of the reason for this is that the tax rates on gambling in New York are the highest in the nation, which has helped the state government increase tax revenue. Despite the high rate, online sportsbooks have still come to New York.</p>

  <p>Park explained that these companies are prioritizing the benefits of operating in a growing market over the drawbacks of paying a high price for the right to do business.</p>

  <p>“They knew what they were getting into,” said Park. “Right now, the status quo is working for everyone.”</p>

  <p>Several online sportsbooks operate in New York. These include FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesars and multiple others.</p>

 <p>Regarding whether or not sportsbooks will attempt to pressure New York into decreasing its tax rate, Park said the future is uncertain.</p>

  <p>“My department works in regulation, not legislation,” Park said. “I can’t predict the future, but the state legislature is prepared to handle the situation as the market develops. Everything is still really new right now.”</p>

  <p>Despite all the benefits for both New York and sportsbooks, there have still been challenges with integrating a new industry into the state. The biggest focus of regulators has been making sure sportsbooks are operating in a transparent way as the state figures out how it can enforce its laws most efficiently.</p>

  <p>“I wouldn’t say it’s a difficulty, but the biggest challenge has been handling such a high volume of bets from multiple operators right away,” Park said. “When there’s a lot going on, you have to pay a lot of attention to make sure everyone is following the rules.”</p>

  <p>Park said that his department has had to focus on making sure new bettors are informed of the odds of their bets, the actual likelihood of winning those bets, as well as what the payout structure is for each betting platform. The most common place for these issues in transparency to occur has been at colleges.</p>

  <p>“Right now, college students are really vulnerable,” said Park. “It’s a newly legal industry, so there are a lot of extra advertisements and promotions that are getting people interested. And on campuses, many students aren’t 21 yet, so they shouldn’t be betting, but that doesn’t stop the advertising there.”</p>

  <p>Enforcing regulations such as financial transparency, targeted advertising, and people skirting minimum age restrictions will be the biggest focus for the New York State Gaming Commission going forwards. However, that action isn’t independent. According to Park, New York’s goal is to work with, not against, sportsbooks to help the industry go in the right direction.</p>
